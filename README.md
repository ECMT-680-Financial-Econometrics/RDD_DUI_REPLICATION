# RDD_DUI_REPLICATION
This repository is a work-in-progress replication of the paper "Punishment and Detterrence: Evidence From Drunk Driving" by Benjamin Hansen, published in the National Bureau of Economic Research. The study uses the different thresholds for a DUI (0.08 BAC) and aggravated DUI (0.15 BAC) as cutoffs for a Regression Discontinuity Design analysis in order to examine recidivism (the tendency of a criminal to reoffend). 

"Regression discontinuity derived
estimates suggest that having a BAC above the DUI threshold reduces recidivism by up to 2 percentage
points (17 percent). Likewise having a BAC over the aggravated DUI threshold reduces recidivism
by an additional percentage point (9 percent)" (Hansen).

In this repository there is: 

hansen_dwi.csv - an Excel file with data used for replication. This is data from administrative records of DUI stops in the state of Washington.

hansen-2015-punishment-and-deterrance-evidence-from-drunk-driving.pdf - The actual paper itself

680_Project_Attempt_2(1).ipynb - A rough draft of a Jupyter notebook file containing our code used for replication and the associated graphs and regression tables. Note that this file is a draft and will be continually updated and refined until the final draft is made.

680_Project_Attempt_3.ipynb - The most updated draft of our replication, an improved file from Attempt 2.

RDD_Project_ECMT_680.pdf - A draft of our poster presentation giving a basic summary of results.
