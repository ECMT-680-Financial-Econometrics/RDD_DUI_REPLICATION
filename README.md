# RDD_DUI_REPLICATION
This repository is a work-in-progress replication of the paper "Punishment and Detterrence: Evidence From Drunk Driving" by Benjamin Hansen, published in the National Bureau of Economic Research. The study uses the different thresholds for a DUI (0.08 BAC) and aggravated DUI (0.15 BAC) as cutoffs for a Regression Discontinuity Design analysis.

In this repository there is: 

hansen_dwi.csv - an Excel file with data used for replication.

Hansen_DUI_Paper.pdf - The actual paper itself

680_Project_Attempt_2(1).ipynb - Our most updated Jupyter notebook file containing our code used for replication and the associated graphs and regression tables. Note that this file is our current working draft and will be continually updated and refined until the final draft is made.
